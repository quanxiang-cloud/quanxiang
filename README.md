## Introduction

QuanXiang is a cloud-native, fully containerized, open source, low-code platform used to assist in building various types of digital applications for enterprises. The platform currently provides two application development modes: no-code and low-code on the cloud, and supports visual design, allowing developers and business users to quickly complete application development through simple drag-and-drop and parameter configuration. As a multi-application integration and management platform integrating low-code development capability, identity authentication capability and container DevOps capability, QuanXiang supports rapid application building, easy maintenance and management of applications, integration of enterprise stock business and full-image cloud building business.


## Features

  </details>



## Architecture

QuanXiang uses a loosely-coupled architecture that separates the frontend from the backend. It provides a plug-and-play, microservices architecture and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks. The platform is divided into: application layer, docking layer, data processing layer and basic layer.

## Installation

QuanXiang privodes a deployment tool, which can help user to quckly deploy QuanXiangCloud low-code platform with a single line of command . QuangXiang deployment tool support most of popular K8S release, currently supported for installation in KubeSphere environments.

<details>
<summary><b>‚ú® Installing on a Kubesphere environment (recommended)</b></summary>

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster environment  v1.21.*
- OpenFunction v0.6.0
- MetalLb  v0.13.7 (*optional*)

### Deploy QuanXiang on KubeShpere(recommend)

#### Prerequisite

Before deploying QuanXiang, below options are required in local environment:

- Accessible KubeSphere cluster.
- 'kubectl' is installed on local. refer [kubectl installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to install kubectl.
- Kubeconfig is configured. refer below steps to configure kubeconfig
  - Get QKE kubeconfig from QingCloud console.
  - For KubeSphere kubeconfig, refer to [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) or ask [community](https://github.com/kubesphere) for more help.
- Helm3 is required. refer [helm3 installation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install helm3.

#### Step 1. Deploy KubeSphere and Openfunction

##### KubeSphere

- Deploy KubeSphere manully, refer [office documentation](https://kubesphere.io/docs/) for more details.
- Using [KubeSphere(R)ÔºàQKEÔºâ ](https://docsv3.qingcloud.com/container/qke/)(recommend) to deploy KubeShere cluster, which is high availability and support automatic inspection and repair.

KubeSphere cluster requirments:

| Node Type | Quantity | Resource Requirment                    |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Master    | 1        | CPU: 4 core, Memory: 8 GB, Disk: 80 GB |
| Worker    | 5        | CPU: 4 core, Memory: 8 GB, Disk: 80 GB |


> **Notice**
>
> Scale nodes' resources to double and use PaaS that privode by cloud vendors, if you want to use QuanXiang as production.

##### OpenFunction

Deploy Openfunction manully, refer [office documentation](https://openfunction.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/)

- Deploy OpenFunction with helm:

```
kubectl create namespace openfunction
helm repo add openfunction https://openfunction.github.io/charts/
helm update
helm install openfunction openfunction/openfunction --version 0.1.0 -n openfunction
```

#### Step 2 Deploy MetalLB (Optional)

Persistence IP address is recommended, that is easily to access QuanXiang web site. Before you deploy MetalLB,  you should prepare several  IP addresses which should  be available.  Refer [official documentation](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/) to more information about installation.

- Following step is copied from MetalLB official web site. 

If you‚Äôre using kube-proxy in IPVS mode, since Kubernetes v1.14.2 you have to enable strict ARP mode.

*Note, you don‚Äôt need this if you‚Äôre using kube-router as service-proxy because it is enabling strict ARP by default.*

You can achieve this by editing kube-proxy config in current cluster:

```bash
kubectl edit configmap -n kube-system kube-proxy
```

and set:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeproxy.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: KubeProxyConfiguration
mode: "ipvs"
ipvs:
  strictARP: true
```

- Deploy MetalLB with helm:

```
helm repo add metallb https://metallb.github.io/metallb
helm repo update
helm install metallb metallb/metallb -n metallb-system --create-namespace
```

- Assign IP pool  to Kubernetes from file ip-pool.yaml, 

```
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: lowcode
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.208.190-192.168.208.195  # replace this to your ips
```

>**Notice**
>
>Those IP address must be accessable and available to use.
>
>

- Apply the IP Pools by "kubectl apply".

```
kubectl apply -f ip-pool.yaml
```

#### Step 3. QuanXiang installation

**Helm Charts installation is enabled after v2.0.0.**

##### Download release

You can download the [release version](https://github.com/quanxiang-cloud/quanxiang/releases/tag/v1.1.0) directly or clone the source code from github.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/quanxiang-cloud/quanxiang.git
```

#### Deploy QuanXiang

QuanxiangCloud deployment tool support production and demo:

- For production, database, cache, message etc. should be installed before you deploy QuanXiang, refer [configurations](https://github.com/quanxiang-cloud/quanxiang/blob/master/doc/install.md#Configurations) for more details.
- For demo, all services will be deployed in Kubernetes.

##### Configurations

For production, you cat set `enable` to `false` to disable middle services in configuration file `quanxiang/values.yaml` . refer to notes in values file for more details.

```bash
# Default values for quanxiang.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

#replicaCount: 1
