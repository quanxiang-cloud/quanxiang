## Introduction

QuanXiang is a cloud-native, fully containerized, open source, low-code platform used to assist in building various types of digital applications for enterprises. The platform currently provides two application development modes: no-code and low-code on the cloud, and supports visual design, allowing developers and business users to quickly complete application development through simple drag-and-drop and parameter configuration. As a multi-application integration and management platform integrating low-code development capability, identity authentication capability and container DevOps capability, QuanXiang supports rapid application building, easy maintenance and management of applications, integration of enterprise stock business and full-image cloud building business.


## Features

QuanXiang builds a low-code ecosystem around application design, development, deployment, operation and maintenance. The core capabilities of the platform are as follows:

  </details>



## Architecture

QuanXiang uses a loosely-coupled architecture that separates the frontend from the backend. It provides a plug-and-play, microservices architecture and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks. The platform is divided into: application layer, docking layer, data processing layer and basic layer.

## Installation

QuanXiang privodes a deployment tool, which can help user to quckly deploy QuanXiangCloud low-code platform with a single line of command . QuangXiang deployment tool support most of popular K8S release, currently supported for installation in KubeSphere environments.

<details>
<summary><b>‚ú® Installing on a Kubesphere environment (recommended)</b></summary>

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster environment  v1.21.*
- OpenFunction v0.6.0

### Deploy QuanXiang on KubeShpere(recommend)

#### Step 1. Deploy KubeSphere and Openfunction

##### KubeSphere

- Deploy KubeSphere manully, refer [office documentation](https://kubesphere.io/docs/) for more details.
- Using [KubeSphere(R)ÔºàQKEÔºâ ](https://docsv3.qingcloud.com/container/qke/)(recommend) to deploy KubeShere cluster, which is high availability and support automatic inspection and repair.

KubeSphere cluster requirments:

| Node Type | Quantity | Resource Requirment                    |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Master    | 1        | CPU: 4 core, Memory: 8 GB, Disk: 80 GB |
| Worker    | 5        | CPU: 4 core, Memory: 8 GB, Disk: 80 GB |

##### OpenFunction

- Deploy Openfunction manully, refer [office documentation](https://openfunction.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/)


> **Notice**
>
> Scale nodes' resources to double and use PaaS that privode by cloud vendors, if you want to use QuanxiangCloud as production.



#### Step 2. QuanXiang installation

##### Prerequisite

Before deploying QuanXiang, below options are required in local environment:

- Accessible KubeSphere cluster.
- 'kubectl' is installed on local. refer [kubectl installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to install kubectl.
- Kubeconfig is configured. refer below steps to configure kubeconfig
  - Get QKE kubeconfig from QingCloud console.
  - For KubeSphere kubeconfig, refer to [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) or ask [community](https://github.com/kubesphere) for more help.
- Helm3 is required. refer [helm3 installation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install helm3.

##### Download release

You can download the [release version](https://github.com/quanxiang-cloud/quanxiang/releases/tag/v1.1.0) directly. **QuanXiang privodes various architecture package.**

##### Build from source code

To build QianXiang deployment tool, that golang 1.16 is needed and special correct GOOS, GOARCH. Example command with Linux and amd64.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/quanxiang-cloud/quanxiang.git
 cd quanxiang/deployment
 CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o installApp main.go
```

> **Notice**
>
> - GOOS: darwin, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD etc.
> - GOARCH: amd64, 386, arm etc.

#### Deploy QuanXiang

QuanxiangCloud deployment tool support production and demo:

- For production, database, cache, message etc. should be installed, refer [configurations](https://github.com/quanxiang-cloud/quanxiang/blob/master/doc/install.md#Configurations) for more details.
- For demo, all services will be deployed in Kubernetes.
